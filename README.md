## Overview

Tryed to center the #Card to the middle of the Screen. Cant reach that with display:Flex; justify-content:center, align-items.center.

I searchd the internet of a solution and find out, that i have to give a spezific height to the element #card.

No Screenshot a.t.m.

## My process

First i build the section #card and put the QR and the Text in seperate articles. So i can now display flex column. 

Than i build a footer arround the given Text (in the footer) and fixed it in the middle on the bottom. 

### Built with

- HTML5 
- CSS custom properties
